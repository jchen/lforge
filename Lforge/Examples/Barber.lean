This is the classic 'barber who shaves themselves' example in logic.
We can model this using a Forge specification and disprove the statement that
there exists a barber using Lean. This is a toy example of our translation working

sig Person {
  shaver: one Person
}

  p = p.shaver

  some barber : Person | all p : Person | {
    not shavesThemselves[p] <=> p.shaver = barber
  }
