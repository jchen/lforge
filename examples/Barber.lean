This is the classic 'barber who shaves themselves' example in logic.
We can model this using a Forge specification and disprove the statement that
there exists a barber using Lean. This is a toy example of our translation working

sig Person {
  shaved_by: one Person
}

pred shavesThemselves[p: Person] {
  p = p.shaved_by

pred existsBarber {
  some barber : Person | all p : Person | {

  }
