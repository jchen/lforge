\emph{The following is a summary of some of the sources and related work I've found: I still need to write this section.}\todo{write this section}

    \item \cite{ullrich2022beyond} discusses Lean 4's capabilities of extensible syntax. 
    \item \cite{lewis2022bi} describes interoperability between Lean and Mathematica. 
    \item \cite{gladshtein2024small} implements the small scale reflection tactic language as a Lean DSL. 
    \item \cite{ngpdbccdlrrvwwk-oopsla-2024} discusses sublanguages of Forge, and that these are viable. We can reasonably restrict language features. 
    \item \cite{milicevic2010executable} makes Alloy executable in Java.

    \item \cite{milicevic2015advancing} not to toot this Milicevic's horn---describes programming environment where imperiative and declarative styles are interweaved. 
    \item \cite{st2023comparison} discuss environments \emph{built around} Forge, for both data processing and verification at simultaneously. \emph{solver-aided programming language}
