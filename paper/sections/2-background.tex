\section{Background}

The following subsections provide the necessary background relating to Forge, Lean, as well as existing work translating and embedding Alloy and related tools in a multitude of target languages. 

\subsection{\emph{Forge}, \emph{Alloy}, and other relational specification languages}\label{sec:bg-forge}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss Alloy and Forge, how they work, etc. 
    \item \cite{torlak2007kodkod} kodkod
    \item \cite{torlak2013applications} discussion of Alloy
    \item \cite{frias2005dynalloy} extends Alloy with actions
    \item \cite{srajesh-honorsthesis,lzhu-honorsthesis} uses Forge to verify privacy policies. But oftentimes this task is made faster within a `real' programming language. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\emph{Lean} and other proof assistants}\label{sec:bg-lean}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{nawrocki2023extensible} discusses Lean user interface
    \item \cite{moura2021lean} discusses Lean's extensibility. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Related Work}\label{sec:bg-related}
\emph{The following is a summary of some of the sources and related work I've found: I still need to write this section.}\todo{write this section}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{ullrich2022beyond} discusses Lean 4's capabilities of extensible syntax. 
    \item \cite{lewis2022bi} describes interoperability between Lean and Mathematica. 
    \item \cite{gladshtein2024small} implements the small scale reflection tactic language as a Lean DSL. 
    \item \cite{ngpdbccdlrrvwwk-oopsla-2024} discusses sublanguages of Forge, and that these are viable. We can reasonably restrict language features. 
    \item \cite{milicevic2010executable} makes Alloy executable in Java. 
    \item \cite{milicevic2014alpha} embeds Alloy in Ruby
    \item \cite{krings2018translation} Alloy to B 
    \item \cite{malik2010translating} z to Alloy
    \item \cite{mikhailov2002approach} Combining Z and Alloy
    \item \cite{milicevic2015advancing} describes programming environment where imperiative and declarative styles are interweaved. 
    \item \cite{st2023comparison} discuss environments \emph{built around} Forge, for both data processing and verification at simultaneously. \emph{solver-aided programming language}
    \item \cite{korner2022embedding} specification as data, embed B specification language in Clojure. 
    \item \cite{arkoudas2004integrating} Proving Alloy specifications in Athena \cite{arkoudas2000denotational,musser2003proving}.
\end{itemize}
